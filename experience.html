<h2>
<font face="Book Antiqua" font color="yellow">Internship</font>
</h2>

<p align="left">
<font face="Courier New" font color="white">It was in the early part of the year.ve done my internship for almost two month at the academic library of university sultan azlan shah at my hometown. I have learn many things there where i got to do variety of works from every department. Ive done all the task in each depart and even get close to the staff there as they are very nice and friendly. I was very about that though at first because im not easily comfortable with new people and i take long time to be able in comfortable zone. Back at my internship topic, all the works are those ive knowledge while learning at the university such as circulation regarding the lending, returning , fines of the overdue material and so on. Other works are such as doing statistic, wrapping book jacket, labelling book, cataloguing and more. It was fun while doing all the works and i find the wrapping the book jacket is the most fun and relaxing. I also can do all the task well through the staff guide. I thoughts it would be fun to work at the library in the future as the work are indeed easily to understand and to do. </font>
