<a name="first">Uncomfortable roomates for two semester</a>
</b>
<p align="justify">
I never thought i would share a room with roomate that im not comfortable before i got in the university. We are four and two of us are friends since pra diploma. They are so loud while im not. From there i can see im not gonna be comfortable forever in the room. They talk bad about others, use bad words, not thinking others feeling, make bad jokes. I actually want to leave the room even the university itself. I have been a roomate with them from semester 1 until 2 in mahsuri and thats a great achievement where i survived it with much feelings, fakeness and stressness. Maybe i got my friends support and love. At first i thought how could im gonna survive this but here iam already got a room at murni for semester 3 and 4 with a better roomate.

<a name="second">How i left alone by my first interim friend</a>
</b>
<p align="justify">
It was during interim. I dont know who i want to be friends with. I dont everyone. So i friend with someone beside me during a session at PI. There i decided to friends with them  so i would not be alone again. However, a time where we must be quickly from PI to Dewan Perdana, we pray together but im a little bit late. After i done, i found out that she left me and go with her another friend. There, it hurts. So i go to Dewan Perdana alone and sadly. After that,  i never talk to her and we being stranger like that relationship during interim never happen. However in the end, i got many friends who are my classmate and we are very close. The end.

<a name="third">Stupidest thing i have done</a>
</b>
<p align="justify">
It was during ramadhan 2016. I go to the city with my friends at night and i go back home with my friend family ride. So i told them to just stop at the side road and i can just walk home from there. That actually was a very stupid decision ive ever done. The shortcut way to home was very dark. I dont even see anything luckily i remember the pave. I stay cool and just walk. After i cross a  ditch, i dont see a small plant infront. At that time, i hears dogs barking at me. So there i panic and almost tripped because of that small plant but not fall. I then continue walk slowly as i dont like being panic. As i arrive home, everybody being curious about the dog barking. As they know the reason is me, they laugh and found it hilarious and there i got a little scold for my stupid action. Others day then i found out that dogs fact is when they saw someone in the dark running, they would though that is a thief and gonna chase he. I then realised luckily im not running that day. When i do stupid action to walk home alone in the dark but it was brilliant to not running. If not maybe im not alive anymore or might have dogs bite scar right now.

<a name="fourth">Where is my other slipper?</a>
</b>
<p align="justify">
During pkp in kolej, i do some assessment in the study room. I got out as i cannot handle the coldness in there. I saw my slipper have no its pair.  I thougt my friends prank me so i scold them.  Its turn out that dogs took one of my slipper. I saw them hugged, play with each other at the ground and my slipper beside them. So i shout from the stairs. They shocked and panic then decide to run but one of them still remember my slipper so he took it and run away. I shouting nonstop as i watch them. The slipper slip away from the dog mouth but they stop then take it back and continue running. I was impress my slipper is so precious to them as they dont want to leave it even during panic. The end my expensive gorgoeus splendid blue and stripes slipper. You will always in my mind. Thank you.</font>
